    <h1>A project for a learning app</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML document to demonstrate a learning app project.</p>
    <h1>Open-Source Learning Dashboard Design</h1>
    <p>Project Description: This project is an open-source UI/UX design initiative for a student progress dashboard. It aims to help learners (and teachers) visualize progress through charts, progress bars, and task lists. ,<br>Key features include a student onboarding screen, a progress-tracker component (e.g. bars or charts for completed lessons), user profile pages, and course overview screens. The design work is managed collaboratively: the main design file is a Figma project, and all work is tracked on GitHub. The README will explain the dashboard’s purpose (tracking student progress in a learning app) and outline how beginners can contribute. ,<br>For example, it will note that the Figma file link is in figma-link.txt, and emphasize that designers should read the README and follow the CONTRIBUTING guidelines

designerup.co,<br>
. T,<br>,<br>The README also lists the project license and links to any design system or style guide. Repository Structure: The repo mimics a real open-source project by including standard files and folders. For example, it contains README.md (project overview and setup instructions), CONTRIBUTING.md (how to contribute), and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md. It also has a LICENSE file (e.g. CC BY or MIT) and a simple figma-link.txt that holds the URL to the shared Figma file. To organize assets and plans, we might have:
issues/ – markdown templates for beginner-friendly tasks (e.g. 01-onboarding-screen.md). Actual GitHub issues would mirror these tasks.
personas/ – user persona documents (e.g. student_persona.md, teacher_persona.md) outlining target user needs.
design/ or style-guide.md – a basic style guide or design system documentation (colors, fonts, component examples).
This structure follows best practices: every open-source project typically has a README, contribution guidelines, a code of conduct, and an issue tracker
designerup.co
. T,<br>hese files help new contributors understand the project, and the issue tracker (“Issues”) is where tasks are managed
designerup.co
. For example, the CONTRIBUTING file will list how to request access, where to ask questions, and how to submit design work.
Contribution Guidelines
Read the Docs First: New contributors should start by reading README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md. The README typically contains vital information like contribution guidelines and license
iamkingsleey.medium.com
. ,<br>This gives a solid understanding of expectations before starting work.
Request Figma Access: Contributors need access to the Figma design file. The figma-link.txt file contains the Figma URL. Depending on our setup, we might create a Figma team for this project. Figma teams can be “open” (anyone in the org can join) or “closed” (join by request)
figma.com
. For example, we could set the team to closed so contributors send a join request; the maintainer then grants editing rights. Contributors should include their Figma account email when requesting access (via an issue or Slack message to the maintainers).
Claim an Issue: Before starting any design work, comment on the GitHub issue that describes the task to let the team know you’re working on it. This avoids duplicate effort. As one guide advises, “leave a comment on the issue to indicate your interest” and confirm it’s not already assigned
iamkingsleey.medium.com
. ,<br>Only after a maintainer or other contributor acknowledges it should you begin work.
Work in Figma: Once an issue is assigned to you, use Figma (or another design tool) to create your designs. Follow any existing style guide for colors, typography, and components. Add new components to the shared Figma library if needed (for example, a new button style or icon).
Share Your Design: When a design is ready, share it as requested in the CONTRIBUTING guide. For instance, you could add a snapshot image to a pull request or link to the Figma frame in a GitHub comment. Always include the editable source: if using Figma, ensure your edits are pushed so others can view/iterate. As recommended, after completing the design in Figma, make sure “to include editable raw files, font folders, and any other design assets” so others can continue the work

.
,<br>Feedback and Communication: Use GitHub comments for discussion. If you have design suggestions or see someone else’s work, comment on the issue or PR. Be courteous and constructive. We expect everyone to follow the project’s Code of Conduct

,<br>
Here are some example GitHub issues (task descriptions) for new contributors:
Issue #1: Design Student Onboarding Screen – Create a welcome/onboarding screen that appears when a new student first uses the dashboard. Include fields for student name and goals, and a “Get Started” button. Use the project’s color palette and style.
Issue #2: Create Progress Tracker Component – Design a reusable component (e.g. a progress bar or radial chart) to show a student’s completion percentage. Make it match the project’s colors and typography.
Issue #3: Design Student Profile Page – Build a mockup for a student profile page showing the student’s photo, name, current course progress, and upcoming tasks.
Issue #4: Design Course Overview Screen – Sketch a dashboard screen listing all enrolled courses with progress bars for each, and a summary of total lessons completed.
Issue #5: Document Style Guide – Write or update a style guide page (style-guide.md) that lists the project’s fonts, color hex codes, and spacing rules. (This helps maintain consistency.)
These tasks are structured to be clear and achievable for beginners. Each issue specifies what to deliver (e.g. a UI mockup or new component). New designers can pick up any issue, comment to claim it, then submit their design following the CONTRIBUTING instructions.
Design Consistency (Style Guide)
,<br>To keep a uniform look across all screens, we use a simple design system. This means defining a shared palette of colors, typography styles, and UI components (buttons, forms, charts, etc.) that all contributors use. For example, we might include a Figma library of buttons and icons. Design tokens (variables for colors, font sizes, spacing) ensure that styles are centralized

mockflow.com
. By doing this, we “establish a cohesive and familiar visual language” throughout the product
mockflow.com
. In practice, the design/ folder or Figma file will contain:
A color palette (primary, secondary, background, text colors).
Typography specs (font families, sizes for headings/body).
A set of UI components (e.g. primary button, input field, card). These are reusable Figma components so everyone uses the same styles.
Following these guidelines makes the dashboard feel consistent and professional. Contributors should reference the style guide when creating new screens. This approach matches industry practice: well-implemented design systems use reusable components and guidelines to speed up design and ensure consistency

,<br>,<br>Weekly Collaborative Sprints
We simulate a simple one-week “sprint” cycle to keep the project moving and teach agile teamwork. For example:
,<br>Monday – Planning Meeting: Every Monday, the team (or anyone interested) meets (via video or chat) to review the project status, recap any user feedback, and choose a task for the week. At this meeting we define what to deliver (e.g. wireframe or high-fidelity mockup) and set a timeline. One UX team’s advice is to pick an “easy task to tackle” and be very specific about deliverables and timeline
uxbooth.com
. ,<br>For instance, this week we might plan to design the onboarding screen and a progress bar component. Each designer self-assigns to a task (in the issue tracker), after commenting to claim it.
,<br>,<br>Tuesday–Thursday – Design Work: Designers work on their assigned tasks in Figma. During the week, everyone can ask for feedback by posting drafts in the team chat or in the issue comments.
,<br>,<br>Friday – Review & Retrospective: On Friday we hold a design review meeting (or group chat). Each designer presents what they made (e.g. screen mockups). The team gives feedback and discusses improvements. This meeting also serves to “present the design and the research results” and then plan the next sprint
uxbooth.com
. We talk about what worked well or didn’t, and update the backlog of tasks.
This weekly cycle (plan Monday, deliver and iterate, review Friday) helps beginners learn teamwork and time management. It mirrors a continuous design sprint: start the week with clear goals, and end with a collaborative review of outcomes
uxbooth.com
. ,<br>,<br>Summary: By organizing the project with clear documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, issue tracker) and a shared Figma file, and by assigning simple weekly tasks, we create a friendly environment for novice designers. All participants learn how to use GitHub for collaboration, comment on issues to coordinate work, and use Figma for real-time design sharing. This open-source dashboard project thus becomes both a useful prototype and a learning platform for teamwork in UI/UX design
